# AI Introduction and Future

## 2. [How AI can enhance our memory, work and social lives](https://www.ted.com/talks/tom_gruber_how_ai_can_enhance_our_memory_work_and_social_lives#t-248994)
- Speaker: Tom Gruber, Co-creater of __Siri__
- 9:46
- 기억이라는 관점에서 인공지능이 우리에게 어떻게 도움을 주고 어떻게 발전되어 나갈 것인지에 대한 내용입니다.  
- How smart can our machines make us? Tom Gruber, co-creator of Siri, wants to make "humanistic AI" that augments and collaborates with us instead of competing with (or replacing) us. He shares his vision for a future where AI helps us achieve superhuman performance in perception, creativity and cognitive function -- from turbocharging our design skills to helping us remember everything we've ever read and the name of everyone we've ever met. "We are in the middle of a renaissance in AI," Gruber says. "Every time a machine gets smarter, we get smarter."

# AI applications

## 2.	[Can a robot pass a university entrance exam?](https://www.ted.com/talks/noriko_arai_can_a_robot_pass_a_university_entrance_exam/transcript)
- Speaker: Noriko Arai (AI expert)
- 13:37
- AI가 어떻게 문제를 해결하는지 예시로 AI에 대해서 설명합니다.   
- AI expert Noriko Arai and her team created Todai Robot, whose sole purpose is to pass the entrance exam for the University of Tokyo, the most prestigious university in Japan. So far it hasn’t succeeded in getting in, even though it scores better than 80 percent of its human competitors.

# Machine Learning - Object Recognitions

## 2. [How computers learn to recognize objects instantly](https://www.ted.com/talks/joseph_redmon_how_a_computer_learns_to_recognize_objects_instantly)
- Speaker: Joseph Redmon(Computer scientist)
- 7:37
- 내용 : YOLO (You Only Look Once) system을 이용하여 실제 영상 처리하는 것을 보여주면서 강의 하는 점에서 영상 처리 + classifier + 신경망 사용을 볼 수 있습니다.
- Ten years ago, researchers thought that getting a computer to tell the difference between a cat and a dog would be almost impossible. Today, computer vision systems do it with greater than 99 percent accuracy. How? Joseph Redmon works on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) system, an open-source method of object detection that can identify objects in images and video -- from zebras to stop signs -- with lightning-quick speed. In a remarkable live demo, Redmon shows off this important step forward for applications like self-driving cars, robotics and even cancer detection.
